# BrandWala / TradeFlow BD — Master Plan

Platform for **parent company + sister-concern** multi-tenant operations across wholesale, retail, commerce, and (later) thrift.

**This document is the index and cross-cutting reference** — vision, locked decisions, implementation phases, feature matrix, permissions, and module catalog. **Domain detail** (schemas, routes, RPCs, UI) lives in linked domain docs; read those when implementing a specific area.

**Quick navigation:** §1–§5 vision & flow | §6–§7 entity summary | §8–§11 decisions & phases | **§10.1** status & next step | **§12** doc map | **§14** feature matrix | **§15** permissions | **§16** schema index | **§17** module index | **§18** flows

---

## 1. Platform vision

One system manages:

- **Procurement** — child orders and product-based costing feed **parent shipments** → [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md)
- **Stock** — parent-owned inventory with optional **child display allocations** → [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md)
- **Sales** — parent or child invoices; desk sales from parent stock → [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md)
- **Shop** — child-owned storefronts, cart, orders from allocated stock → [SHOP_ORDER.md](SHOP_ORDER.md)
- **Reports & treasury** — margin reports and payment settlement (read-side P&L) → [REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md)
- **Capital** — investors, cost-share per shipment, investor portal → [INVESTOR_CAPITAL.md](INVESTOR_CAPITAL.md)

Business lines share the same **global entity model** (`global_stocks`, `global_invoices`, …). Thrift remains a separate vertical in phase 1.

---

## 2. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Frontend | Quasar (Vue 3) + Pinia |
| Mobile | Capacitor (Android); Thrift-app is a separate mobile client |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres, RLS, RPCs) |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages |
| IDs | `bigint` (int) everywhere |

**Scopes:**

| Scope | Route | Users |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Platform | `/platform` | Superadmin |
| App | `/:tenantSlug/app` | Internal membership (admin, staff, viewer) |
| Shop | `/:tenantSlug/shop` | Customer group members |
| Investor | `/:tenantSlug/investor` | Investor (`investor_portal` submodule; auth migrating to `role = investor`) |

Full scope rules, guards, and redirects: [APP_SCOPES_AND_ACCESS.md](APP_SCOPES_AND_ACCESS.md).

---

## 3. Tenant model (summary)

| Role | `tenants.parent_id` | Responsibility |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Parent company** | `NULL` | Shipments, stock, investors, consolidated reports, cash dashboard |
| **Child (sister concern)** | `= parent.id` | Customer groups, orders, costing, commerce, own invoices |
| **Standalone** | `NULL`, no children | Same global tables; `parent_tenant_id := tenant_id` |

**Constraint:** Only one hierarchy level — a child cannot have children.

**Modules (feature flags):** Superadmin enables per tenant via `tenant_modules` (no inheritance). Each feature needs: DB seeder, `MODULE_REGISTRY`, `modulePermissions.ts`, guarded routes, bootstrap inclusion.

Legacy modules (`inventory`, `invoice`, `accounting`, `shipment`, `investor`) **remain** for existing tenants until cutover. New parent-module families (`procurement_stock`, `sales_invoice`, `reporting_treasury`, `investor_capital`, `global_reference`) are **additive keys**.

**Full detail:** [TENANT_MODEL_AND_ACCESS.md](TENANT_MODEL_AND_ACCESS.md) — resolution, membership, investor actors, module assignment, RLS.

---

## 4. End-to-end business flow

```
Child: orders / product costing  →  Parent: shipment (local or international)
  →  Parent: global_stocks  →  child_tenant_stock_allocations (optional)
  →  Child: global_invoice  →  payments / invoice_payments
  →  reporting_treasury: margin reports (read)  →  investor profit share
```

**Commerce** does **not** create inbound shipments. It **sells from parent `global_stocks`**.

**Product based costing** stays **costing → parent shipment** (no mandatory order in between).

---

## 5. Shipment types

| Type | `shipment_type` | Currency | Cost input |
|------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| **Local** | `local` | BDT | Direct `cost_bdt` on lines |
| **International** | `international` | GBP | `price_gbp` + rates → computed `cost_bdt` |

All stored costs in accounting use **BDT**. Landed-cost formulas: [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md).

---

## 6. Global entities (summary)

**Rule: global tables are the only write target for operational data.** No dual-write. Legacy tables are migrated then dropped (§9).

| Entity family | Primary tables | Detail document |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Stock & allocations | `global_stocks`, `global_stock_quantities`, `child_tenant_stock_allocations` | [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) |
| Shipments | `global_shipments`, `global_shipment_items` | [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) |
| Invoices | `global_invoices`, `global_invoice_items`, `global_return_items`, `invoice_charge_lines` | [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) |
| Profiles | `billing_profiles`, `recipient_profiles` | [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) |
| Payments | `global_payments`, `invoice_payments` | [REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md) |
| Margin reports | Read-side from invoice lines + shipment batches | [REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md) |
| Investors | `investors`, `investor_transactions`, `shipment_investments` | [INVESTOR_CAPITAL.md](INVESTOR_CAPITAL.md) |
| Reference data | `global_currencies`, `markets`, `payment_methods`, `units_of_measure` | [GLOBAL_REFERENCE_DATA.md](GLOBAL_REFERENCE_DATA.md) |

**Target direction:** Retire `global_accounting_ledger` writes in favour of read-side margin ([REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md) §1). Legacy rollups (`global_shipment_accounting`, `global_invoice_accounting`) are replaced by report queries during transition.

**Stock network RPC:** `search_stock_network(context_tenant_id, mode)` — modes: `page`, `search`, `invoice`.

---

## 7. Procurement into parent shipment

Sources for `add_child_line_to_parent_shipment`: `order_items`, `product_based_costing_items`. **Not** commerce.

**Full detail:** [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) §procurement lines.

---

## 8. Locked decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Write model | Global tables only; no dual-write (D1) |
| Commerce | Sell from parent stock; operating `tenant_id` = child (D2–D3) |
| Thrift | No phase 1 global integration (D12) |
| Standalone tenant | `parent_tenant_id = tenant_id` (D5) |
| Investor remainder | Parent company bears cost-share gap below 100% (D10) |
| Invoices | Fresh insert on `global_invoices` |
| Cost at sale | `unit_cost_price` immutable snapshot from landed cost (D7) |
| Costing → order | Not required; optional convert later (D11) |
| Module enablement | `tenant_modules` per tenant; no inheritance (D13) |
| Margin / P&L | Computed on read — no shadow ledger (see REPORTING_TREASURY) |

Full decision log: §14.3.

---

## 9. Deprecation (post-migration)

**Drop:** `inventory_items`, `inventory_stocks`, `invoices`, `invoice_items`, `inventory_accounting_entries`, `shipment_inventory_accounting`, `v_shipment_accounting_ledger`, `shipments.is_gbp`.

**Keep:** `orders`, `shipments`, `shipment_items`, `product_based_costing_*`, `commerce_*`, `payments`, `customer_groups`, `investors`, `thrift_*`.

---

### 14.3 Decision log (locked)

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|-------|----------|
| D1 | Write model | Global tables only; no dual-write |
| D2 | Commerce inbound | Commerce does **not** create shipments |
| D3 | Commerce outbound | Sells from parent `global_stocks` |
| D4 | Tenant hierarchy | One level only |
| D5 | Standalone tenant | `parent_tenant_id := tenant_id` |
| D6 | Domestic shipment | Conversion rates forced to 1.0 |
| D7 | Landed cost | Snapshot to `unit_cost_price` at sale |
| D8 | Bulk payments | `global_payments` + manual `invoice_payments` slices |
| D9 | Billing vs recipient | Separate profiles — essential for dropship |
| D10 | Investor remainder | Parent bears cost-share gap below 100% |
| D11 | Costing → order | Not required; optional later |
| D12 | Thrift | No phase 1 global integration |
| D13 | Module enablement | `tenant_modules` per tenant; no inheritance |
| D14 | Role abilities | **Today:** code matrix in `modulePermissions.ts` (view only). **Target:** tenant-scoped custom roles + DB grants per [PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md](PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md) — Administrator auto-access on enabled modules; B8/F8 last |
| D15 | Margin / P&L | Read-side from transactions — no shadow ledger |

---

## 15. Permission schema & role matrix

> **Target design (DB-backed grants, per-user overrides, shop flags):** [PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md](PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md) — implement **B8/F8 last** after domain cutover. §15.3 below is **today’s** code matrix.

### 15.1 Access model

| Layer | Source (today) | Source (target) | Controls |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 — Scope | Route prefix | Same | Actor table (memberships / customer_group_members) |
| 2 — Tenant modules | `tenant_modules` | Same | Feature on/off per tenant |
| 3 — Grants | `modulePermissions.ts` | `tenant_roles` + `tenant_role_grants` + member overrides (+ shop profile/access) | Custom + system roles × module × action |
| 4 — Action catalog | — (view only) | `module_actions` | Valid actions per module |
| 5 — Row access | RLS + RPCs | Same + `has_module_action()` | Tenant / parent isolation |

**Implementation today:** [LOGIN_NAV_PERMISSION_FLOW.md](LOGIN_NAV_PERMISSION_FLOW.md). **Scope detail:** [APP_SCOPES_AND_ACCESS.md](APP_SCOPES_AND_ACCESS.md).

### 15.2 Actor roles

| Scope | Roles | Auth table |
|-------|-------|------------|
| platform | superadmin | memberships (tenant_id null) |
| app | admin, staff, viewer | memberships |
| shop | customer_admin, customer_negotiator, customer_staff | customer_group_members |
| investor | investor | memberships (`role = investor`, linked `investor_id`) |

## 16. Redesign entity model (index)

> **Target schemas live in domain docs.** This section is a quick index only. Current-vs-target table mapping is in §16.1.

| Entity | Target table(s) | Detail document |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Global currency | `global_currencies` | [GLOBAL_REFERENCE_DATA.md](GLOBAL_REFERENCE_DATA.md) |
| Global shipment | `global_shipments`, `global_shipment_items` | [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) |
| Global stock | `global_stocks`, `global_stock_types` | [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) |
| Billing / recipient | `billing_profiles`, `recipient_profiles` | [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) |
| Global invoice | `global_invoices`, `global_invoice_items` | [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) |
| Payments | `global_payments`, `invoice_payments` | [REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md) |
| Investors | `investors`, `investor_transactions`, `shipment_investments` | [INVESTOR_CAPITAL.md](INVESTOR_CAPITAL.md) |

### 16.1 Current vs target mapping

| Entity today | Target | Action |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| `shipments` | `global_shipments` | Rename + currency/vendor FKs |
| `shipment_items` | `global_shipment_items` | Add landed cost, add_method |
| `global_stocks` + `global_stock_quantities` | Simplified `global_stocks` + `global_stock_types` | Redesign |
| `business_parties` / inline recipient | `recipient_profiles` | New table |
| `invoice_charge_lines` | Inline on `global_invoices` or charge lines | Per SALES_INVOICE |
| `payments` | `global_payments` | `unallocated_amount` |
| `payment_allocations` | `invoice_payments` | Rename + `allocated_at` |
| `global_accounting_ledger` | Read-side margin queries | Retire writes |
| `orders` (legacy) | Retire → `shop_order` vendor path | [SHOP_ORDER.md](SHOP_ORDER.md) |
| `commerce_*`, `store`, `cart` | Retire → `shop_order` | [SHOP_ORDER.md](SHOP_ORDER.md) |
| `thrift_*`, `koba_*` | No change | STABLE |

## 17. Module index

> **Per-module detail** (routes, RPCs, UI, submodule trees) is in the domain doc column. Modules without a domain doc use §14.1 matrix row + codebase.

## 18. End-to-end flows

```
Child: orders / product costing → Parent: shipment (local or international)
  → Parent: global_stocks → child_tenant_stock_allocations (optional)
  → Child: global_invoice → global_payments / invoice_payments
  → reporting_treasury: margin reports (read) → investor profit share
```

| Flow | Path | Status | Detail |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| B2B order | cart → order → negotiate → shipment pull | STABLE | §17 #6 |
| Costing | product_based_costing → shipment line | STABLE | [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) |
| Receive stock | shipment receive → global_stocks | DONE | [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) |
