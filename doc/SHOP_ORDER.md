# Shop & Order

BrandWala / TradeFlow BD uses a **parent module** for customer-facing storefronts: shop configuration, carts, and orders. **Child tenants** (sister concerns) create and own their shops. Stock-backed shops sell only from **`global_stock_allocations`** assigned to that child. Vendor-catalog shops expose supplier assortment for procurement intent. Fulfillment converges on existing global domains — procurement pull or **`global_invoices`** — not a parallel commerce ledger.

This document is written as a **reusable domain pattern**: shop types, two-layer customer permissions, multi-currency amounts, and display-vs-sellable quantity are applicable beyond this codebase whenever a B2B portal must serve multiple catalog modes from shared inventory.

## User stories

### Parent — `shop_order` (Shop & Order)

**As a** child-tenant admin,  
**I want** one nav group for shops, customer-group permissions, pricing, carts, and orders,  
**So that** each customer segment gets the right catalog, checkout rules, and fulfillment path — without mixing desk sales or parent procurement.

---

### Submodule — `shop_config` (Shops)

**As a** child-tenant admin,  
**I want to** create shops under my tenant and choose type plus order behaviour,  
**So that** I run vendor catalogs, fixed-price storefronts, or dropship portals independently.

| Shop type | User story |
|-----------|------------|
| **Vendor catalog** | **As an** admin, **I want to** link a shop to a `vendor_code` and show that vendor's available products, **so that** buyers place procurement intent (bulk or small MOQ) with optional price visibility per group. |
| **Fixed price** | **As an** admin, **I want to** list allocated stock lines with a sell price and choose whether customers see quantity, **so that** I sell from my tenant slice at a fixed checkout price. |
| **Dropship** | **As an** admin, **I want to** set sell price and minimum sell price per allocated line, **so that** drop shippers cannot undercut the floor while choosing their customer-facing price. |

---

### Submodule — `shop_permissions` (Customer group access)

**As a** child-tenant admin,  
**I want to** define default shop capabilities per customer group and override them per shop,  
**So that** one group negotiates and sees prices while another only browses and requests quotes.

---

### Submodule — `shop_storefront` (Storefront)

**As a** customer group member,  
**I want to** see only shops my group can access, with prices and quantities governed by my permissions,  
**So that** I get the right experience on each storefront.

---

### Submodule — `shop_cart` (Cart)

**As a** customer,  
**I want to** maintain a cart per shop with soft stock reservation on stock-backed shops,  
**So that** I can build an order before submitting without overselling allocated inventory.

---

### Submodule — `shop_order_mgmt` (Orders)

**As a** customer negotiator,  
**I want to** submit negotiable orders and exchange offers with staff,  
**So that** we agree on price before procurement placement.

**As a** customer staff member,  
**I want to** checkout at the displayed sell price without negotiation,  
**So that** fixed-price and dropship orders complete quickly.

**As an** internal staff member,  
**I want to** review, price, negotiate, approve, or cancel shop orders,  
**So that** only confirmed lines enter shipment pull or invoicing.

---

### Submodule — `shop_fulfillment` (Fulfillment)

**As a** staff user,  
**I want to** convert a placed vendor-catalog order into procurement lines or a stock-backed order into a desk invoice,  
**So that** stock, margin, and payments stay on the global stack.

## 1. Overview

| Property | Shop & Order |
|----------|--------------|
| Scope | Child tenant (or standalone) owns shops; parent allocates stock |
| `tenant_id` | Issuing sister concern on all `shop_*` rows |
| Auth surface | App (`memberships`) for config; Shop (`customer_group_members`) for browse/cart/order |
| Module gating | `shop_order` parent + submodules |
| Primary UI (target) | App: `/:slug/app/shop/*` — Shop: `/:slug/shop/*` |
| Write target | `shop_*` tables only (fresh stack) |

### What this domain is

| Capability | Submodule | Responsibility |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Shop setup | `shop_config` | Create shops, type, order mode, stock display defaults |
| Group permissions | `shop_permissions` | Tenant-wide group profiles + per-shop access grants |
| Shop pricing | `shop_pricing` | Listings, sell/min prices, display quantity override |
| Storefront | `shop_storefront` | Customer browse with permission-masked fields |
| Cart | `shop_cart` | Per-shop cart, reservations against allocations |
| Orders | `shop_order_mgmt` | Place, negotiate, approve, cancel |
| Fulfillment | `shop_fulfillment` | Procurement pull or `global_invoice` handoff |

### What this domain is not

| Topic | Is not |
|-------|--------|
| **Desk sales** | Staff invoice UI lives under `sales_invoice` — shop fulfillment **calls into** `global_invoices` |
| **Inbound procurement** | Parent shipments live under `procurement_stock` — vendor-catalog orders are **inputs** to pull, not creators of shipments |
| **Physical stock ownership** | Child does not own `global_stocks` — only `global_stock_allocations` slices |
| **Separate commerce ledger** | No `commerce_accounting` stack — payments follow [REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md) on desk invoices |
| **Legacy shop tables** | No FK to `stores`, `carts`, `orders`, `commerce_*` — concept reuse only |
| **Koba / Thrift** | Isolated verticals — out of scope for `shop_order` v1 |

### Reusable design patterns (portable beyond BrandWala)

| Pattern | Where used | Why reusable |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Shop type enum** | `vendor_catalog` \| `fixed_price` \| `dropship` | Any B2B portal mixing catalog browse, fixed checkout, and partner pricing |
| **Two-layer permissions** | Profile defaults + per-resource overrides | Standard RBAC for customer groups without role explosion |
| **Amount + currency FK** | Products, listings, cart snapshots, order lines | ISO-style money without hard-coded column names (`price_gbp`) |
| **Allocation-backed listing** | Fixed + dropship | Tenant slice of shared inventory — applies to any hub-and-spoke stock model |
| **Display vs sellable qty** | `display_quantity_override` vs `available_to_sell` | Marketing buffer without breaking inventory caps |
| **Order mode matrix** | Shop type × `order_mode` × `is_negotiable` | Same cart, different checkout semantics |
| **Fresh tables + legacy UI borrow** | Backend new, frontend patterns from legacy browsers | Safe migration without dual-write |

```

### Implementation split

| Layer | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| **Backend** | **Fresh start** — new `shop_*` tables and RPCs; no FK to legacy shop/order/commerce tables (same pattern as [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) §3) |
| **UI** | Reuse UX patterns from legacy `StoreProductsBrowser`, `CommerceStoreProductsBrowser`, order negotiation pages — rewire to new repositories only |
| **Products** | **Migrate in place** — replace `price_gbp` with amount + `global_currencies` FK (prerequisite phase) |

## 1a. Gap Analysis & Legacy Negotiation Analysis

Before starting the full-scale implementation of shop order negotiation features, a gap analysis was performed comparing the legacy `brand-wala-wholesale` project against the new architecture in `brandwala-wholesale-quasar-v2`.

### Legacy Negotiation Issues (`brand-wala-wholesale`)
1. **Lack of Shop Configurations**: Legacy had no `shops` or `stores` table/collection concept. All orders were placed directly under a `market_id` and `vendor_id`. Consequently, there was no way to customize features (such as toggling negotiation status, setting currencies, or choosing pricing methods) per storefront.
2. **Rigid Transition Lifecycle**: The status flow (`submitted -> priced -> under_review -> finalized -> ordered`) locked down customer inputs once the order entered `under_review` (the "Negotiate" phase). During this phase, the customer's UI became read-only, preventing any iterative back-and-forth negotiation loops.
3. **Hardcoded Currency Assumptions**: Pricing and offers were hardcoded as BDT (Bangladeshi Taka) for sales and GBP (British Pound) for purchase cost, with no option to modify the transaction currencies per vendor or shop.
4. **No Customer Profile Controls**: There were no profile-based negotiation flags or overrides. Customer capabilities were determined solely by hardcoded roles.

### Current Implementation Gaps in `brandwala-wholesale-quasar-v2`
1. **Shop Currency Settings**: The `shops` table contains only a single `default_currency_id`. It lacks explicit dual-currency configurations (Buy currency vs. Sell currency) and does not enforce the rule that negotiations happen in the Sell currency.
2. **Retail Price Configurations**: There is no database setting or UI configuration allowing admins to decide whether the displayed retail price should use direct cost or a markup percentage. Toggling stock quantity display (original vs. override custom quantity) is also missing.
3. **Dropship Floor Price Validation**: Although the `shop_product_listings` table contains `minimum_sell_price_amount`, the storefront and cart validation rules are missing checks to prevent reseller listings from falling below the minimum sell price.
4. **Bilingual Info ("I") Button**: In both the shop create and edit dialogs (`ShopFormDialog.vue`), the help tooltip modal does not detail the new pricing configurations, currency settings, or negotiation options in both Bangla and English.

---

## 2. Module hierarchy

**Parent module key (target):** `shop_order`  
**Display name:** Shop & Order  
**Nav pattern:** Parent group with submodule children (same model as `procurement_stock`, `sales_invoice`, `global_reference`).

| Key | Display name | `parent_module_key` | Scope | Nav route (target) |
|-----|--------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|
| `shop_order` | Shop & Order | `null` | — | *(group header)* |
| `shop_config` | Shops | `shop_order` | app | `shop/shops` |
| `shop_permissions` | Customer Access | `shop_order` | app | `shop/customer-groups` |
| `shop_pricing` | Shop Pricing | `shop_order` | app | `shop/shops/:id/pricing` |
| `shop_storefront` | Storefront | `shop_order` | shop | `shop/browse/:shopSlug` |
| `shop_cart` | Cart | `shop_order` | shop | `shop/cart` |
| `shop_order_mgmt` | Orders | `shop_order` | app + shop | `shop/orders`, `app/shop/orders` |
| `shop_fulfillment` | Fulfillment | `shop_order` | app | `app/shop/orders/:id` |

Redirect legacy routes when cut over:

- `/shop/stores` → `/shop/browse`
- `/app/store/*`, `/app/commerce/*` → `/app/shop/*` (per-tenant flag)

### Assignment rules

- Superadmin assigns **`shop_order`** on a tenant via `tenant_modules`.
- `get_active_module_keys_for_tenant` expands parent → enabled submodule keys.
- Platform can disable individual submodules via `tenant_module_submodules`.
- Submodule keys gate nav/pages; cross-module list RPCs (currencies, stock search) remain available where RLS allows.

### Tenant eligibility

| Tenant type | `shop_order` | Who creates shops |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Parent company | No (by default) | Parent does **not** create child storefronts |
| Child (sister concern) | Yes | Child `admin` / `staff` |
| Standalone | Yes | Tenant `admin` / `staff` |

**Ownership rule (D-SH9):** `shops.tenant_id` = the operating child (or standalone). Parent only **allocates** stock via `global_stock_allocations`; it does not own shop rows.

### Legacy keys (transition)

| Legacy key | Status | Replaced by |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `store` | Retire | `shop_config` + `shop_storefront` |
| `cart` | Retire | `shop_cart` |
| `order_management` | Retire | `shop_order_mgmt` (vendor path) |
| `commerce_shop` | Retire | `shop_config` + `shop_pricing` |
| `commerce_cart` | Retire | `shop_cart` |
| `commerce_order` | Retire | `shop_order_mgmt` |
| `commerce_invoice` | Retire | Fulfillment → `global_invoices` |
| `commerce_accounting` | Retire | `reporting_treasury` on desk invoices |

Enable `shop_order` on new tenants first; legacy keys stay for existing tenants until cutover.

---

## 3. Shop types and order modes

Shop **type** is set at create and **immutable**. Order **mode** and **negotiation** configure checkout behaviour.

### 3.1 Shop types

| Type | `shop_type` | Catalog source | Stock required | Details / Configurations |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Vendor catalog (Procurement)** | `vendor_catalog` | `products` where `vendor_code = shops.vendor_code` and `is_available` | No | Catalog ordering when product is not present. Order negotiable toggle is set based on the user profile for the shop. If negotiable, full negotiation flow is supported. |
| **Fixed price (Retail)** | `fixed_price` | `shop_product_listings` → `global_stock_allocations` | Yes | Stock-backed. Admin configures display selling price (Direct Cost vs. Markup) and quantity display option (Original Quantity vs. Custom Override). |
| **Dropship** | `dropship` | Same as fixed price | Yes | Reseller storefront. Shows suggested sell price and minimum sell price (floor price constraint) that the reseller must sell at. |

### 3.2 Order modes

| Mode | `order_mode` | Typical shop types | Customer experience |
|------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Procurement intent** | `procurement_intent` | `vendor_catalog` | Quote / negotiate → staff places for parent shipment pull |
| **Fixed checkout** | `checkout_fixed` | `fixed_price`, `dropship` | Cart → confirm → invoice |
| **Wholesale checkout** | `checkout_wholesale` | `fixed_price` (optional) | Account-based wholesale invoice path |

### 3.3 Negotiation flag

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `shops.is_negotiable` | When `true`, order may enter `negotiating` status |
| Effective negotiate | `is_negotiable` **and** `effective(can_negotiate)` from permissions **and** `order_mode` allows it |
| Dropship | `is_negotiable` must be `false` (enforced by check constraint) |

### 3.4 Behaviour matrix

| `shop_type` | `order_mode` | `is_negotiable` | Downstream |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| `vendor_catalog` | `procurement_intent` | true | Negotiate → `placed` → procurement pull |
| `vendor_catalog` | `procurement_intent` | false | Staff prices → `confirmed` → `placed` → pull |
| `fixed_price` | `checkout_fixed` | false | `confirmed` → `fulfilled` → `global_invoice` retail |
| `fixed_price` | `checkout_wholesale` | true/false | `global_invoice` wholesale |
| `dropship` | `checkout_fixed` | false | `global_invoice` type `dropship` (dual amounts) |

Not every cart produces the same order path — the matrix above is enforced at `submit_shop_order_from_cart`.

### 3.5 Shop Currency Settings

Every shop must configure dual currencies to distinguish origin costing from retail pricing:
1. **Buy Currency** (`buy_currency_id`): The currency in which the product was or will be purchased from suppliers (e.g., GBP, USD). This drives origin costing snapshots.
2. **Sell Currency** (`sell_currency_id` / `default_currency_id`): The currency in which the product will be listed, sold, and checked out (e.g., BDT).
3. **Negotiation Currency Rule**: All counter-offers, negotiations, and pricing agreements must happen in the **Sell Currency** (`sell_currency_id`).

---

## 4. Stock-backed shops (fixed price & dropship)

### 4.1 Allocation as the sellable slice

Child tenants sell only from rows in `global_stock_allocations` where `child_tenant_id = shops.tenant_id`. See [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) §5.6.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  pool["global_stocks parent pool"] --> alloc["global_stock_allocations"]
  alloc --> listing["shop_product_listings"]
  listing --> cart["shop_cart_items"]
  cart --> order["shop_order_items"]
  order --> invoice["global_invoices post"]
```

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Listing FK | `shop_product_listings.global_stock_allocation_id` required for stock-backed shops |
| Denormalize | `global_stock_id`, `product_id` copied for display joins |
| Eligibility | Parent shipment **Ready Stock** + sellable `global_stock_type` only |
| Deduction | On invoice post (or explicit fulfill RPC) — decrement allocation / parent pool per [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) |

### 4.2 Quantity model (display vs sellable)

Three quantities drive behaviour. This separation is **reusable** anywhere UI may show marketing stock while checkout stays honest.

| Concept | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Allocated qty** | `global_stock_allocations.quantity` | Physical ceiling for this child |
| **Reserved qty** | `SUM(shop_stock_reservations.quantity)` | Active cart holds |
| **Pending order qty** | Open order lines not yet fulfilled | Soft commit |
| **Display override** | `shop_product_listings.display_quantity_override` | Optional inflated qty shown in UI |

**Computed in RPCs (not stored):**

```text
available_to_sell =
  allocated_qty
  − reserved_qty
  − pending_order_qty

display_qty =
  if NOT effective(can_view_quantity) OR NOT shop.show_stock_quantity → null
  else if display_quantity_override IS NOT NULL → display_quantity_override
  else → GREATEST(0, available_to_sell)
```

| Behaviour | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Show extra qty | Admin sets `display_quantity_override` **higher** than `available_to_sell` — customer sees more; checkout still capped |
| Hide qty | `shops.show_stock_quantity = false` or listing `show_quantity = false` |
| Checkout guard | `quantity_ordered ≤ available_to_sell` always |
| Per-line override | `shop_product_listings.show_quantity` may hide qty for one line while shop default shows |

### 4.3 Dropship pricing

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `sell_price_amount` | Suggested / default sell price shown to drop shipper |
| `minimum_sell_price_amount` | Floor — customer-entered sell price must be ≥ minimum |
| `customer_sell_price_amount` | On cart/order line when `effective(can_set_dropship_price)` |
| Dual invoice amounts | On fulfill → `global_invoice` dropship: `sell_price_amount` (accounting) + `recipient_price_amount` (face) per [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) |

---

## 5. Customer group permissions (two-layer model)

> **Unified permission design:** [PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md](PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md). Shop uses **shop-scoped `tenant_roles`** on `customer_group_members` for module actions, plus **Subsystem B** resource flags below. Tenant admin configures shop roles and member overrides in **Access Control** (`/:slug/app/access-control`).

Portable pattern: **tenant-wide defaults** + **per-shop overrides** with `COALESCE(override, default, safe_fallback)`.

**Member role assignment:** `customer_group_members.tenant_role_id` → shop-scoped `tenant_roles` → `tenant_role_grants`. Optional `customer_group_member_grants` for individual overrides. Enum `customer_group_members.role` remains login gate until future cleanup.

### 5.1 Layer A — `customer_group_shop_profiles`

One row per customer group per child tenant. Defines **default** shop capabilities when a shop grant is created.

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `tenant_id` | bigint FK | — | Child tenant |
| `customer_group_id` | bigint FK | — | Group |
| `is_active` | boolean | true | Master switch |
| `default_can_browse` | boolean | true | See shop in list |
| `default_see_price` | boolean | false | Unit prices visible |
| `default_can_add_to_cart` | boolean | true | Add lines |
| `default_can_place_order` | boolean | true | Submit / checkout |
| `default_can_negotiate` | boolean | false | Counter-offers |
| `default_can_view_quantity` | boolean | true | Stock qty when shop shows stock |
| `default_can_set_dropship_price` | boolean | false | Edit dropship sell on line |

**Unique:** `(tenant_id, customer_group_id)`

**Suggested seed from `customer_group_members.role`:**

| Member role | Typical defaults |
|-------------|------------------|
| `admin` | All true except `see_price` per commercial policy |
| `negotiator` | `can_negotiate`, `can_place_order` |
| `staff` | Cart + place; no negotiate |

Roles seed defaults only — **effective permissions always come from profile + access rows**.

### 5.2 Layer B — `shop_customer_group_access`

Per-shop grant for a customer group.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `shop_id` | bigint FK | |
| `customer_group_id` | bigint FK | |
| `status` | boolean | Grant on/off |
| `can_browse` … `can_set_dropship_price` | boolean **null** | `null` = inherit from profile default |
| `price_tier_code` | text null | Future tier pricing hook |
| `credit_limit_amount` + `credit_limit_currency_id` | nullable | Optional per-shop+group commercial cap |

**Unique:** `(shop_id, customer_group_id)`

### 5.3 Effective permission resolution

```text
effective(shop, group, flag) =
  IF shop_customer_group_access.status = false
     OR customer_group_shop_profiles.is_active = false
  THEN false
  ELSE COALESCE(
    shop_customer_group_access.<flag>,
    customer_group_shop_profiles.default_<flag>,
    false
  )
```

Safe fallback `false` applies to `see_price`, `can_negotiate`, `can_set_dropship_price`.

### 5.4 Permission × shop type

| Permission | vendor_catalog | fixed_price | dropship |
|------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| `can_browse` | Vendor products | Listed lines | Listed lines |
| `see_price` | List / reference price | Sell price | Sell + min sell |
| `can_view_quantity` | MOQ only | Display qty | Usually min-sell focus |
| `can_add_to_cart` | Add lines | Add lines | Add lines |
| `can_place_order` | Submit intent | Checkout | Checkout |
| `can_negotiate` | If shop `is_negotiable` | Rare | No |
| `can_set_dropship_price` | — | — | Edit line sell ≥ min |

### 5.5 Security-definer RPCs

| RPC | Returns |
|-----|---------|
| `get_shop_permissions_for_customer(p_shop_id)` | All effective flags for session group |
| `can_customer_access_shop(p_shop_id)` | `effective(can_browse)` |
| `can_customer_see_shop_price(p_shop_id)` | `effective(see_price)` |
| `can_customer_negotiate_on_shop(p_shop_id)` | `effective(can_negotiate) ∧ shop.is_negotiable` |

Storefront and cart RPCs **mask** price, quantity, and dropship fields using these helpers.

---

## 6. Multi-currency product catalog (prerequisite)

Legacy `products.price_gbp` is not reusable across markets. **Phase 0** migrates the catalog before shop tables.

### 6.1 `products` target columns

| Remove | Add |
|--------|-----|
| `price_gbp` | `list_price_amount numeric(12,4) null` |
| — | `list_price_currency_id bigint null → global_currencies(id)` |
| — | `reference_cost_amount numeric(12,4) null` |
| — | `reference_cost_currency_id bigint null → global_currencies(id)` |

**Check:** `(list_price_amount IS NULL) = (list_price_currency_id IS NULL)` — same for reference cost pair.

### 6.2 Money column convention (all shop tables)

Every monetary value uses:

```text
<name>_amount numeric(12,4) NOT NULL
<name>_currency_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES global_currencies(id)
```

No `price_gbp`, `price_bdt`, or other currency-specific column names in new tables.

### 6.3 One-time backfill

```sql
-- illustrative
UPDATE products SET
  list_price_amount = price_gbp,
  list_price_currency_id = (SELECT id FROM global_currencies WHERE code = 'GBP')
WHERE price_gbp IS NOT NULL;
-- then DROP price_gbp
```

### 8.3 Key RPCs

| RPC | Actor |
|-----|-------|
| `get_or_create_shop_cart` | Customer |
| `add_to_shop_cart` / `update_shop_cart_item_qty` | Customer |
| `submit_shop_order_from_cart` | Customer |

## 9. Integration with other domains

| Domain | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| [PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md](PROCUREMENT_STOCK.md) | Stock-backed listings from `global_stock_allocations`; vendor `placed` lines join pull RPC |
| [SALES_INVOICE.md](SALES_INVOICE.md) | `fulfill_shop_order_to_invoice` creates `global_invoices`; dropship dual amounts |
| [REPORTING_TREASURY.md](REPORTING_TREASURY.md) | Payments on fulfilled invoices — no shadow commerce ledger |
| [GLOBAL_REFERENCE_DATA.md](GLOBAL_REFERENCE_DATA.md) | All `*_currency_id` columns |
| [TENANT_MODEL_AND_ACCESS.md](TENANT_MODEL_AND_ACCESS.md) | `customer_groups` child-only; shop actors from `customer_group_members` |

---

## 10. Fresh start — no legacy connection

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| New table prefix | `shop_*` only |
| No FK | To `stores`, `carts`, `orders`, `commerce_*` |
| No dual-write | Locked decision **D-SH1** |
| UI reuse | Legacy components may be copied/rewired; repositories target new tables |
| Legacy data | Not migrated — parallel run per tenant until cutover |

## 12a. Bilingual Information Guide (I Button)

To ensure admin users understand all configuration choices, a bilingual Help Dialog ("I" button) is integrated directly into the Shop Create and Edit forms. The content covers:

### 1. Shop Types (দোকানের ধরন)
*   **English**: 
    *   **Procurement Intent (Vendor Catalog)**: Used when the product is not physically present in inventory. The customer browses the supplier's catalog and places an order. Order negotiation is optional and governed by the user's profile permission for that shop.
    *   **Retail Shop (Fixed Price)**: Stock-backed storefront. Products are sold directly from branch inventory. Admins configure how prices are calculated (direct cost vs markup) and how quantities are shown (original quantity vs custom display quantity).
    *   **Dropship Shop**: Reseller portal where the buyer sets their own customer price. The listing displays both the Sell Price and the Minimum Sell Price (floor price constraint) to prevent price undercutting.
*   **Bangla (বাংলা)**:
    *   **ক্রয় অনুরোধ (ভেন্ডর ক্যাটালগ)**: পণ্য যখন স্টকে থাকে না তখন ব্যবহৃত হয়। কাস্টমার সাপ্লায়ারের ক্যাটালগ দেখে অর্ডারের অনুরোধ করে। দরকষাকষির বিষয়টি ঐচ্ছিক এবং দোকানের জন্য ব্যবহারকারীর প্রোফাইল পারমিশন দ্বারা নির্ধারিত হয়।
    *   **খুচরা দোকান (নির্ধারিত দাম)**: ফিজিক্যাল স্টক-ব্যাকড দোকান। শাখা বা চাইল্ড টেন্যান্টের স্টক থেকে সরাসরি বিক্রি। অ্যাডমিন নির্ধারণ করতে পারেন দাম কীভাবে দেখানো হবে (সরাসরি খরচ নাকি মার্কআপ সহ) এবং স্টকের পরিমাণ কীভাবে প্রদর্শিত হবে (আসল স্টক নাকি কাস্টম সংখ্যা)।
    *   **ড্রপশিপ দোকান**: রিসেলার পোর্টাল যেখানে রিসেলার ক্রেতার কাছে নিজের বিক্রয়মূল্য সেট করতে পারেন। এখানে দুটি মূল্য দেখানো হয়: বিক্রয়মূল্য এবং ন্যূনতম বিক্রয়মূল্য (ফ্লোর প্রাইস), যা রিসেলারকে ন্যূনতম মূল্যের নিচে পণ্য বিক্রি করতে বাধা দেয়।

### 2. Shop Currencies (দোকানের কারেন্সি সেটিংস)
*   **English**: 
    *   Every shop operates with two currencies:
        1. **Buy Currency**: The currency in which the product was or will be purchased from suppliers (e.g. GBP, USD). Used for back-office cost logging.
        2. **Sell Currency**: The currency in which the customer views prices and completes checkout (e.g. BDT).
    *   All customer-facing pricing and active negotiations happen in the **Sell Currency**.
*   **Bangla (বাংলা)**:
    *   প্রতিটি দোকানের দুটি কারেন্সি থাকে:
        ১. **ক্রয় কারেন্সি**: যে কারেন্সিতে পণ্যটি সাপ্লায়ারের কাছ থেকে কেনা হয়েছে বা হবে (যেমন GBP, USD)। এটি ব্যাক-অফিস খরচের হিসাব রাখার জন্য ব্যবহৃত হয়।
        ২. **বিক্রয় কারেন্সি**: যে কারেন্সিতে কাস্টমার দাম দেখবে এবং পেমেন্ট সম্পন্ন করবে (যেমন BDT)।
    *   কাস্টমার-ফেসিং সমস্ত প্রাইসিং এবং দরকষাকষি অবশ্যই **বিক্রয় কারেন্সিতে** সম্পন্ন হবে।

### 3. Retail & Quantity Pricing Configurations (খুচরা মূল্য ও পরিমাণ সেটিংস)
*   **English**:
    *   **Direct Cost vs. Markup**: Decide if checkout price displays the baseline cost directly or applies a customized percentage markup.
    *   **Original vs. Custom Quantity**: Choose to expose actual physical stock availability or define a custom marketing override quantity to show in the storefront.
*   **Bangla (বাংলা)**:
    *   **সরাসরি খরচ বনাম মার্কআপ**: বিক্রয়মূল্য সরাসরি বেসলাইন খরচে নাকি কাস্টম পার্সেন্টেজ মার্কআপ যোগ করে দেখানো হবে তা নির্ধারণ করুন।
    *   **আসল বনাম কাস্টম স্টক**: ওয়্যারহাউজের ফিজিক্যাল আসল স্টক কাস্টমারকে সরাসরি দেখানো হবে নাকি একটি কাস্টম মার্কেটিং সংখ্যা ওভাররাইড হিসেবে দেখানো হবে তা বেছে নিন।

## 13. Legacy feature mapping (concept only)

| Legacy | New |
|--------|-----|
| `stores` + `store_access` | `shops` + `shop_customer_group_access` |
| `store_access.see_price` | `see_price` effective permission |
| `carts` / `cart_items` + `price_gbp` | `shop_carts` / `shop_cart_items` + currency pairs |
| `orders.negotiate` + status enum | `shops.is_negotiable` + `shop_orders.status` |
| `store_product_prices` + `stock_override` | `shop_product_listings` + `display_quantity_override` |
| `commerce_cart` reservations | `shop_stock_reservations` |
| `commerce_orders` | `shop_orders` checkout path |
| `commerce_invoice` | `global_invoices` via fulfillment |

---

## 14. Locked decisions

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|-------|----------|
| D-SH1 | Legacy isolation | New `shop_*` tables only; no FK to legacy shop/order/commerce |
| D-SH2 | Stock source | Fixed + dropship sell from child `global_stock_allocations` (inherits **D3**) |
| D-SH3 | Vendor downstream | `placed` vendor-catalog lines eligible for parent shipment pull |
| D-SH4 | Currency | Amount + `global_currencies` FK — no currency-named columns |
| D-SH5 | Shop type | Immutable after create |
| D-SH6 | Permissions | Two-layer: `customer_group_shop_profiles` + `shop_customer_group_access` |
| D-SH7 | Invoice handoff | Fulfillment writes `global_invoices` — not `commerce_invoice` |
| D-SH8 | Negotiation | Only when `is_negotiable` and effective `can_negotiate` |
| D-SH9 | Shop ownership | Child (or standalone) creates and owns `shops` |
| D-SH10 | Listing FK | Stock-backed listings reference `global_stock_allocation_id` |
| D-SH11 | Display qty | Override affects display only; checkout capped by `available_to_sell` |
| D-SH12 | Dropship | `minimum_sell_price` floor; dual amounts on invoice per **D-SI*** |

---

## 15. Open choices (decide before B-SH1)

| Topic | Options | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Shop currency | Single `default_currency_id` vs per-line override | Shop default + line override for import catalogs |
| Vendor catalog pricing | Staff-only price step vs always negotiable | Both supported via `is_negotiable` |
| Koba vertical | Fold into `shop_order` vs stay isolated | Stay isolated in v1 |
| Tenant cutover | Big-bang vs parallel modules | `shop_order` on new tenants first |
| Credit limit enforcement | Block checkout vs warn only | Warn in v1; hard block in v2 |
